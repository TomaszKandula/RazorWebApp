                    Razor WebApp is an opposite of the <a href='https://github.com/TomaszKandula/UnsecureWebApp' target='_blank'>Unsecure WebApp</a> 
                    that has been written for the sole purpose of the article titled <a href='https://medium.com/&#64;tomasz.kandula/sql-injection-1bde8bb76ebc'>SQL Injection</a>

                    The idea behind this Razor Pages application is to build a small web application using server-side rendering and plain JavaScript 
                    for client-side interactions (it uses classes and components). It should:
                </p>
                <div class="content">
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Validate user input: front-end via own code or validate.js (preferable); back-end via model validation or FluentValidation (preferable).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use AJAX to perform asynchronous calls to Web API, secured by Anti-Forgery Token.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Provide tests for Razor Pages with Anti-Forgery Token.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use OR/M (Entity Framework Core) and LINQ instead of ADO.NET with custom SQL strings.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Protect user password by hashing and salting with <a href='https://auth0.com/blog/hashing-in-action-understanding-bcrypt/'>BCrypt</a>. 
                            Please note that we do not use SHA2_512 and GUID for hashing and salting on the server-side via SQL stored procedures 
                            (this would be the alternative approach, most likely implemented by DBA). Using BCrypt (or SCrypt) is much preferable.
                        </li>

                <p>
                    User interaction is coded with plain JavaScript, no third party libraries/frameworks used. Code is organized into modules. 
                    Each Razor Pages has its own dedicated JavaScript class that adds events, performs binding and render buttons component, and message box 
                    component (it returns HTML for given handle). While this is relatively clean, it may not be easy to maintain; such an approach usually 
                    leads to significant overhead, and it is not recommended for broader usage.

                    How does it work?

                <div class="mb-3">
                    There are five web pages, among them most important are <strong>Register page</strong> (allows to create new user account) and <strong>Login page</strong> (allows to login to the given account).
                    Once the account is created we display modal window with the confirmation. However, if the user is logged, then we setup a 15 minutes session and redirect back to this page.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    The back-end uses Web API so when a user is logged, further API calls to the controllers must contain both XSRF token and Session Id. Please be mindful that this is not complete solution
                    (for example, we do not send registration confirmation email, thus by default, newly created account is activated), the scope of this demo application is limited.
